##`Description:`

#####Guess the Country of the Flag a trivia game. To play the game, first select one of the three major continents: The Americas, Africa, and/or Eurasia(a combination of European & Asian countries), and then a flag from that continent will appear with three different country options to choose from. Score of the correct answer is tracked and a message will appear at the end based on how well you scored. Guess the Country of the Flag was inspired from watching street videos of people getting asked what country a flag was from and a personal interest to build/create a game that is fun and educational at the same time.
