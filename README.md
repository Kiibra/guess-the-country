## Guess the Country of the Flag
---

### `Description:`

##### Guess the Country of the Flag is a trivia quiz game inspired from street interviews of people guessing what country a flag was from. It was also a personal interest of mine to build & create a something that was fun and educational. To play this quiz game, select one of the three major continents: The Americas, Africa, and/or Eurasia(a combination of European & Asian countries). Then a flag from that continent will appear with three different names of countries to choose from. The score of the correct answers is tracked and a message will appear at the end based on how well you scored. Have fun!!
